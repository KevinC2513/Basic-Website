          <div> We were founded in 2003, when our founder Kevin Chen was doing homework. He once again bumped up against the sharp edges of the table, and as he winced in pain and sat down, he tried to push in the drawers only for them to get stuck. It was at this time that he decided that enough was enough, people deserved nice furniture. He enlisted the help of his good friend Justin Zhang.</div>
          <div> Justin just so happened to also had a bone to pick with terrible tables. He was forced to sit hunched over everyday due to his height and how low tables generally were. Thus Justin determined to fix his posture agreed to become the lead designer of their first table.</div>
